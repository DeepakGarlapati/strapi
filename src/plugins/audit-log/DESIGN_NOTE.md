# Strapi Audit Log - Technical Design Document

## 1. System Overview

### 1.1 Purpose
Design and implement a comprehensive audit logging system for Strapi that:
- Automatically captures all content changes
- Provides secure, queryable access to audit data
- Maintains high performance at scale
- Integrates seamlessly with existing Strapi architecture

### 1.2 Design Goals
- Minimal performance overhead
- Real-time logging capability
- Flexible query interface
- Secure access control
- Easy maintenance and extensibility

## 2. Architecture Design

### 2.1 Core Components

#### Event Capture Layer
- Utilizes Strapi lifecycle hooks for direct database event monitoring
- Synchronous operation ensures data consistency
- Minimal overhead and reliable capture of all changes

#### Data Storage Layer
- Dedicated `audit_logs` collection
- Optimized schema and indexing
- Efficient JSON payload storage

#### API Layer
- RESTful endpoints for querying
- Flexible filtering system
- Pagination and sorting support

### 2.2 Integration Strategy

We chose Strapi lifecycle hooks over alternatives like Event Hub for several reasons:
1. **Direct Database Integration**
   - Immediate access to database transactions
   - No additional infrastructure required
   - Guaranteed consistency with database state

2. **Performance Considerations**
   - Minimal overhead per operation
   - No external service dependencies
   - Synchronous logging capability

3. **Maintainability**
   - Simple deployment model
   - Clear debugging path
   - Easy upgrades

### 2.3 Service Architecture

The plugin uses a centralized service architecture:

1. **Core Service (`audit-log.ts`)**
   - Handles all logging operations
   - Manages filtering and pagination
   - Provides unified API for other plugins

2. **Controller Layer**
   - REST endpoint implementations
   - Request validation
   - Response formatting

3. **Policy Layer**
   - Access control enforcement
   - Permission checking
   - Request filtering

## 3. Technical Implementation

### 3.1 Data Model
```typescript
interface AuditLog {
  id: number;
  contentType: string;      // Index for filtering
  recordId: string;         // Index for lookups
  action: "create" | "update" | "delete";
  user?: number;           // Foreign key to users
  timestamp: Date;         // Index for time-based queries
  payload: {              // JSON field for flexibility
    [key: string]: any;
  };
}
```

### 3.2 Database Optimization
1. **Indexes**
   - Primary: `id`
   - Compound: `(contentType, timestamp)`
   - Single: `user`, `action`
   
2. **Query Patterns**
   - Filter by content type (frequent)
   - Filter by date range (frequent)
   - Filter by user (occasional)
   - Full text search (rare)

### 3.3 Security Implementation
1. **Access Control**
   - Role-based permissions
   - Endpoint-level auth
   - Data sanitization

2. **Configuration**
   ```typescript
   interface Config {
     enabled: boolean;
     excludeContentTypes: string[];
   }
   ```

## 4. Performance Considerations

### 4.1 Query Optimization
- Strategic index utilization to improve lookup performance
- Pagination to reduce response size and server load
- Caching considered for frequently executed queries

### 4.2 Storage Efficiency
- Compression applied to JSON payloads for reduced footprint
- Selective capture of fields to avoid unnecessary data storage
- Routine maintenance tasks to preserve operational efficiency

### 4.3 Scaling Strategy
- Architecture supports horizontal database scaling
- Proactive index optimization for dataset expansion
- Option to incorporate read replicas for increased throughput

## 5. Architectural Trade-offs

| Decision | Advantages | Trade-offs | Mitigation Strategies |
|----------|------------|------------|----------------------|
| Lifecycle Hooks | Immediate access to core entity lifecycle | Higher coupling to data layer | Clear integration boundaries |
| JSON-based Storage | Flexible schema evolution | Data size growth over time | Compression and selective field logging |
| Synchronous Logging | Ensures consistent capture | Possible latency overhead | Future batching and performance tuning |
| REST-only API | Accessible and simple implementation | Limited querying possibilities | Future GraphQL interface planned |

## 6. Future Enhancements

### 6.1 Roadmap Capabilities
1. Real-time event notifications
2. Enhanced querying and filtering
3. Configurable retention and cleanup policies
4. Long-term archival and cold storage workflows

### 6.2 Integration Expansions
- Output stream support for message queues (Kafka, RabbitMQ)
- Integration with SIEM and log aggregation platforms
- Reporting and analytical insights
- Administrative UI dashboard for visual exploration

## 7. Conclusion

The Strapi Audit Log plugin provides a robust foundation for tracking content modifications across the system. The current implementation demonstrates:

1. **Performance Optimization**
   - Minimal impact on primary operations
   - Efficient retrieval and storage methodologies
   - Scalable architecture prepared for data growth

2. **Security Controls**
   - Strong access restrictions and policy management
   - Protection of sensitive information
   - Adjustable governance rules

3. **Maintainability and Extensibility**
   - Clean, modular code organization
   - Comprehensive internal documentation
   - Designed to evolve with future enhancements

The architecture remains scalable, reliable, and maintainable through the centralization of core logic in a custom plugin and the consistent application of Strapi event-driven hooks.
